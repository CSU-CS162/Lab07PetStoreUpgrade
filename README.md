Model for Inheritance (Where the curved boxes represent are the functions and the square boxes are the classes)
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Pets]--> E(get/setName, get/setBreed, makeNoise);
    E --> B[Cat];
    E --> C[Dog] -->G(playFetch);
    E --> D[Hamster] --> H(wheelRun);
    E --> I[Bird] --> J(eatSeeds);
```




Cat can definitely do overloading with badNameâ€“have a getName() and a getName(String badName) instead
Add a Bird class with a bunch of overloaded methods and more practice overriding with things like makeNoise()

- bird had generic makeNoise()
- it also has makeNoise(int) that makes a different noise depending on what int is (if statements or switch statements work here)


- eatSeeds() -- this one returns that the bird ate the seeds (string)
- eatSeeds(bool) -- this one returns whether the bird ate the seeds or not (string)
- eatSeeds(int) -- this one returns how many seeds the bird ate (string)
